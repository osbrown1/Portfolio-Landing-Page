  <h2>My Background:</h2>
  <div>
    <p>I'm a University graduate with a bachelor's in Philosophy and a minor in Communications. I've had job experience in sales, retail, and hospitality.  I realized I wanted to pursue a different carreer path that felt more intellectually stimulating, challenging, rewarding, and had a higher skill ceiling. That's why I decided to take a class on programming.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <div>
      <p>I am a musician who still enjoys reading philosophy, playing guitar, and more recently, programming.</p>
