  <h2>My Background:</h2>
  <div>
    <p>I'm a University graduate with a bachelor's in <em><span>Philosophy</span></em> and a minor in <em><span>Communications.</span></em> I've had job experience in <span>sales, retail, and hospitality.</span>  I realized I wanted to pursue a different carreer path that felt more intellectually stimulating, challenging, rewarding, and had a higher skill ceiling. That's why I decided to take a class on <em><span>programming.</span></em></p>
  </div>

  <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <div>
      <p>I am a musician who still enjoys reading philosophy, playing guitar, and more recently, programming.</p>

    <h3><p>That's all for now, but there are more projects to come.</p></h3>
