  <h1>Hi, my name's Owen, Welcome to my Portfolio Landing Page.</h1>
  <h2>My projects:</h2>

    <h2>My Background:</h2>
    <p>I'm a University graduate with a bachelor's in Philosophy and a minor in Communications. I've had job experience in sales, retail, and hospitality. After Graduating, I was doing direct sales for charities for a year, then I was a front desk agent at a hotel for another year, and until recently I was a server at a bakery. I realized I wanted to pursue a different carreer path that felt more intellectually stimulating, challenging, rewarding, and had a higher skill ceiling. That's why I decided to take a class on programming.</p>
